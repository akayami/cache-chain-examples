# cache-chain-examples

## basic.js

A very basic example of usage of [cache-chain](//github.com/akayami/cache-chain) using [memory store](https://github.com/akayami/cache-chain-memory) and [redis store](https://github.com/akayami/cache-chain-redis). Should work without any further changes provided redis is locally installed and running.
